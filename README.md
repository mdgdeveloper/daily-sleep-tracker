# Description
This application provides a trend analysis of the sleep evolution of the user by using a CRUD API. The technology for the frontend solution is ReactJS while for the backend tasks, Express together with MongoDB are the technologies selected. 

Based on the idea from [Daily Sleep Tracker in Code Mentor](https://www.codementor.io/projects/web/daily-sleep-tracker-web-app-byi4kpk5rt)

# Data Structures
## Entries
### GoToBedEntry
Definition of `goToBedEntry` 

```js
{
    id: ID,
    date: date,
    type: gotobed,
    status: open/closed
}
```
### WakeUp entry
```js
{
  id: ID,
  goToBedID: ID, // Obtained as last-id. 
  date: date,
  type: wakeup,
  time: date,
  wakeUpRating: number
}
```

### Sleep Entry
```js
{
  id: ID,
  startDate: date,
  endDate: date,
  sleepTime: number, // Minutes
  wakeUpRating: number,
  dayRating: number
}
```

# Data Flow
## User Insertion
1. New Entry
2. Date is automatically obtained from current time, however, the user is able modify it. 
3. Start Time
  * The app stores current time, and leaves the messages of expecting Wake Up Time for the date
  * Until the user does not provides that information, that entry is not closed. 
4. Send

## User Entry closure
1. Close Entry
2. End Time 
3. Wake Up Status
4. New Sleep Entry 
5. Send

## User Sleep Entry Rating 
1. Once the Sleep Entry is created, add as pending to review.
2. The user can evaluate the day for the next 24 hours. 
3. Remove the notification. 

### Method List
1. getLastWeek(date)
2. getLastMonth(date)
3. setStartTime(date)
4. setEndTime(date, rating)


## Divide the Insertion in Two Steps
* Before sleeping.
  * Should be something easy: 2 clicks at most. 
* After Waking Up

## Provide information about the performance perception of the day
* Before sleeping. 

## User Analysis
1. Direct access
2. Dashboard access
